You are analyzing smartphone accelerometer data. The accelerometer measures acceleration in m/s² along three axes:
- X-axis: lateral (side-to-side) movement
- Y-axis: vertical movement (includes ~9.8 m/s² gravity when phone is upright)
- Z-axis: forward/backward movement

Your task is to classify the activity as one of: sitting, walking, running

Example 1 (sitting):
[Sensor Context]
This data is from a smartphone accelerometer measuring acceleration in m/s² along three orthogonal axes (x, y, z). When stationary, gravity contributes approximately 9.8 m/s² to one axis. Movement creates deviations from this baseline.
