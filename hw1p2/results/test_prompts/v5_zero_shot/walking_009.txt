You are an expert at analyzing smartphone accelerometer data for human activity recognition.

[Sensor Information]
Accelerometer measures acceleration in m/s² along x, y, z axes. Gravity contributes ~9.8 m/s².

[Activity Signatures]
- SITTING: Gravity-dominated, very low variance (std < 0.2), no periodic motion (freq ~0 Hz)
- WALKING: Periodic at ~1.5-2.0 Hz (step frequency), moderate variance (std 1-3)
- RUNNING: Periodic at ~2.5-3.5 Hz, high variance (std 3-6), pronounced peaks

Based on your knowledge of human motion and accelerometer physics, classify this data:
[Statistical Summary]
X-axis: mean=-0.01, std=1.17
Y-axis: mean=-0.02, std=0.59
Z-axis: mean=9.81, std=1.57
Magnitude: mean=9.90, std=1.58
Dominant frequency: 2.0 Hz

Classification (sitting/walking/running):
