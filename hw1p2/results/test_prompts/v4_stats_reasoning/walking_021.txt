You are analyzing statistical features extracted from smartphone accelerometer data.

[Activity Patterns]
- Sitting: std < 0.2, dominant frequency ~0 Hz
- Walking: std 1-3, dominant frequency 1.5-2.0 Hz
- Running: std 3-6, dominant frequency 2.5-3.5 Hz

[Examples with Reasoning]
Example 1:
Statistics: X(mean=-0.0, std=0.05), Y(mean=-0.0, std=0.05), Z(mean=9.8, std=0.05), Magnitude(std=0.05), DominantFreq=22.6Hz
Reasoning: Very low standard deviation across all axes and near-zero dominant frequency indicate no periodic motion. This is consistent with a stationary position.
Classification: sitting

Example 2:
Statistics: X(mean=0.0, std=1.18), Y(mean=-0.0, std=0.59), Z(mean=9.8, std=1.55), Magnitude(std=1.57), DominantFreq=2.0Hz
Reasoning: Moderate variance with dominant frequency around 2 Hz matches typical walking cadence of ~120 steps/minute.
Classification: walking

Example 3:
Statistics: X(mean=-0.0, std=2.25), Y(mean=0.0, std=1.20), Z(mean=10.0, std=3.45), Magnitude(std=3.47), DominantFreq=3.0Hz
Reasoning: High variance and dominant frequency near 3 Hz indicates fast periodic motion with strong impacts, consistent with running.
Classification: running
